# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.



## Reference

This portfolio website was developed as part of a university assignment for my Bachelor of Information Technology degree in Southern Institute of Technology. 

The initial structure and design were inspired by a tutorial I followed on Bilibili,

 the original link is :  

https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1D54y1u7a7/?spm_id_from=333.1387.favlist.content.click&vd_source=03c144d4db11e6ff1ea72ca1696eb5de

which helped me understand how to build a modern web application using React. Throughout the development, I replaced all default content with my own personal information, including work experience, skills, and projects. I also customized the icons, images, and styles to better reflect my individual identity.

The tutorial served as a learning resource, and I made modifications to ensure the final product is a unique representation of my own profile. This project was completed with the intention of learning and practicing front-end development skills.
